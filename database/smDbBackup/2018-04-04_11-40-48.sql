INSERT INTO `blogs` VALUES (9,'How to Get or Attract Traffic on Social Media?','Getting social media traffic is more of a set of disciplined actions than just a particular objective. It requires proper plan with strategic approaches, and the combination of the right skills.','<p>One of the top challenges that today&rsquo;s B2B marketers undergo nowadays is leveraging social media traffic. Because you can consider social media as one of your first priorities for traffic, you have to invest the most of your time and efforts to get the most of it. You might provide some updates or come up with occasional tweets. But, that&rsquo;s not going to be enough, especially when you want to move the dial of your call and convey your appeal to the intended audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, here are the finest techniques you can adopt to excel in drawing and gathering social media traffic, quality of course.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Might of The Link/CTA:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It may seem obvious, but always include a link/CTA back to your website. It not only drives traffic but shows your reader what to do next. No matter how much someone likes your brand, if you don&#39;t ask them to visit your website, give them a compelling reason to, and make it easy, they are not likely to do it. So, always user social media as a teaser and include a website link for more information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doing this may be difficult on platforms like Instagram and Vine, but you can always change and direct people to the link in your bio as companies like HubSpot do.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Power of Images:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is crucial to use images in your social media posts when sharing content, especially now that the majority of social media users are on mobile devices. Images are more eye-catching than text alone and they also take up more room in the timeline, helping you attract more attention. Also, the right image can help prospects visualize what the content is going to be about while also making a post more &quot;shareable.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Integration of Social Share Buttons:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s great when you can drive a lot of social media traffic, but it&#39;s even better when other people do it for you. If your website doesn&#39;t already have social sharing buttons, you could be missing out on a lot of social media traffic that&#39;s generated from people already reading your blog!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Social sharing buttons are those colorful buttons you see around the top or bottom of blog posts that allow you to share the page directly on the social media channel of your choice. They provide convenience to your buyer persona and act as a non-pushy tool that encourages social sharing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paid Promotion:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You may call it the step of Sponsored Content. The quickest way to drive more traffic from social media is through paid promotion. When you&#39;re executing on a solid social media strategy, paid promotion or &quot;sponsored content&quot; adds fuel to the fire. You can experiment with different targeting options (including location, gender, industry and interests on most profiles) to help expose new people to your content and promote new social media traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the business models of social media platforms evolve, B2B marketers will likely have to pay to be seen. Facebook has been this way for a few years now and with the recent introduction of algorithmic timelines on Twitter and Instagram, this is likely a trend to continue.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Activity and Engagement:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Too many B2B brands are guilty of not updating their social media enough. The only way to keep your followers engaged is to post updates and interact with people on a regular basis. Otherwise, they are likely to forget about you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we tell B2B marketers they aren&#39;t active enough on social media, their minds immediately picture a teenage girl glued to her phone as she posts non-stop selfies and updates on her every movement. We then assure them that being active doesn&#39;t require you to dedicate your life to social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Consistency:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you study the B2B brands with the best marketing, you&#39;ll notice they are always consistent with their social media activity. Regularly posting high-quality, interesting content, and responding to comments keeps your page lively and engaging rather than a one-sided conversation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Honestly speaking, gathering social media traffic is a unified approach that stands on a set of tasks and a clear orientation. Once you can handle the above steps; you can certainly expect great outcomes.</p>','how_to_get_or_attract_traffic_on_social_media.png','how-to-get-or-attract-traffic-on-social-media',0,1,0,112,0,'Proven Techniques To Get Social Media Traffic | Latest Insights','Social media traffic','Different marketers put different efforts to come out successful in gathering Social media traffic.

As we you need to make a video viral, all you have to do is stick to some fundamental matters.','<p>Do you want to make a video so popular that you can call it a viral piece? Then, read the following lines with patience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You have the right recipe with the right type and amount of ingredients. With all these in place, the only thing you can expect that the entire culinary process will become easier. The first few times you take an approach to get the cooking right will be challenging and so misleading that you have to wait for some time. So, you want to make a video viral?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s get straight to the real business.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Keep your video sweet and short.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Short videos are good to become inspirational, educative, and engaging. For longer videos, you need to consider why you are going to spend so much of your time on something that is expensive and potentially not so effective for your purposes. But, it does not mean that longer videos are just bad. They are equally and sometimes more beneficial just when you are sure the video has a real value to offer your customers or viewers. Thus, you take the initial steps right to make a video viral.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Work to spread a single message.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Content that sounds simple, demonstrates clear, and feels succinct are really wonderful. For a high conversion copy or landing page, it is substantial. For a blog article that is super shareable, it is even more credible. For a potentially viral video, the fact is not only true but also compelling. Move ahead with a single message. Do not confuse your viewers with multiple messages which they find difficult to connect or understand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Make the title short, interesting, and symmetrical to your brand&rsquo;s purposes. Attention! About 50% of all video marketers fail to use a title that works. Use trendy, relevant keywords to optimize the video for search engines and video platforms like YouTube, Dailymotion, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Offer value.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Nothing works better than something in the world of the Internet that provides value. Create videos that are intrinsically useful to people who you consider as your audience. No matter if you are trying to inform, educate or entertain. Adding values should be your central focus.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Be wary of format.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Increase the likelihood of your video&rsquo;s being viral by optimizing and modifying it for mobile devices and social sharing. The right format is critical to the acceptance of your videos on social media platforms. Be sure to keep the video at optimal resolutions with great sound. However, do not allow bigger file size.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Thumbnails matter.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A catchy thumbnail satisfies the curiosity and simultaneously draws the attention of thousands of your potential viewers. Don&rsquo;t fake this chance. A lot of video makers or spammy marketers use incorrect or duplicate thumbnails that ultimately end in the loss of genuine subscribers or future customers. Try to make thumbnail become the essence of your video so that viewers do not have to wait to get a grasp of what you are going to show them. It&rsquo;s a compulsion if you have to make a video viral.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Be careful about the use of text.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Some unconscious video marketers use text, compelling though, so unwisely that viewers feel distracted by the text. Sometimes, the text, even though it&rsquo;s useful, does not look clear. Remember, the text does not look great on some screens. Try to avoid using content this way. If you have to do it anyway, be serious about making a transition between the text and video content, so viewers do not feel like being lost in either of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember that you can never know how long it will take you to make a video viral. But, you go through trials and errors while sticking to the job, and that&rsquo;s what is going to work in the end.</p>','how_to_viral_a_video.png','how-to-viral-a-video',0,0,0,0,0,'Fundamental Steps To Make A Video Viral | Learn How To Viral A Video','Make a video viral','For those trying to make a video viral, the key aspects include the making of short videos with valuable content, great title, and audio and an amazingly descriptive thumbnail.

Some are good and some are not.','<p>In a word, YES.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Billions of people across the countries of the world are using one or another social media network every day. A large portion of them use the networks for just one purpose called socializing. Another fair share of the users is working to make a living using the platforms. The multifaceted uses of different social networks are the reasons why these virtual platforms are being overwhelmingly popular.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People are talking, sharing, showing, working, and meeting on these media.

Keep reading&hellip;&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;NICE to have&rdquo; is an obsolete idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you look at a business that has its own vision, you will see social networks has gained a much higher position in the operational strategy of that business. Once, businesses used to feel that having access to a great media like Facebook or Twitter is good. Ask them the same question. The likely reply is going to be like this, &ldquo;Having a familiarity on any virtual network is an essential thing to ensure.&rdquo; So, nothing surprising the fact should be if you hear that your friend, once a Facebook enthusiast, has built a great career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;BANKS of future&rdquo; is not a thing of the distant future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ultimate thing first!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It won&rsquo;t be an unbelievable thing to know that these networks are going to have an impact on people&rsquo;s prospects to get a loan. Banking relationships are being heavily transformed by these media. Think about customer service or online money transactions. Many things from &lsquo;this&rsquo; to &lsquo;that&rsquo; of the financial landscape have a greater chance of being transformed, and social media will likely be the major player.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Change in HEALTHCARE delivery&rdquo; is only a matter of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you ask which factor outside the public health domain is mostly responsible for the changes in healthcare in recent times, the interference of social media is the only answer we have found after comprehensive research sessions. A large number of people find social channels convenient and proactive to share their information quite rapidly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Health experts may not be available all the time. Social platforms being two-way places allow nonmedical persons to share what they know about a particular health condition. However, there are controversies regarding the authenticity of information shared by non-experts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although this transmission of information seems positive, it is not free of its setback. Such an opportunity ushers the flow of misinformation. But, health agencies can always take countermeasures to tackle the situation. Proper plan to share information and stop the flow of wrong information can be the priority of health agencies to be of help to the community dependent on them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The new home to GOVERNANCE&rdquo; is real.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Social media has transformed civic engagement and participation. Citizens can become the initial source of plans, initiatives, and ideas in a more interactive way than before. More and more influential people and leaders are expected to embrace transparent governance as social channels have made it easy for them to interact and cooperate with their constituents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, social media is consistently aiding us in responding more promptly to different calamities and disasters. Human rights violations are now being watched across the globe without the interreference of conventional news media. Thus, social media platforms are having remarkable impacts upon the continual changes in our lifestyle.</p>','is_social_media_changing_our_lifestyle.png','is-social-media-changing-our-lifestyle',0,0,0,1,1,'The Way Social Media Platforms Affect How Live & Interact','Social media','Social media is getting impeccably popular due to their influences upon the way people live, socialize, work, and cooperate with their close associates.

It has its merits and demerits. So, every marketer needs to be aware of them before adopting a particular PR strategy.','<p>As soon as you have decided to actualize a public relation strategy for your business, it is time to give these publications a serious thought. Press releases are a powerful tool to help spread your message across a broad group of audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Press releases for marketing are no unmixed blessings but one of the conventional ways to initiate the launch of a product or service.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Advantages of Press Releases:</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>As a conveyer of your message:</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You want your news to reach out front to people with press release distribution. For many businesses, it has been possible to earn success by submitting a press release to the famous wire and make sure its submission to numerous publications, and then reposting to other online locations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>As a contributor to link building:</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Press releases for marketing help build links. Even when a small press release does not necessarily help with SEO, the editorial coverage that you get from them will bring great benefits to your SEO. Ensure that you include keywords that you want to rank for your releases. So, when journalists see the release, they will include some of these keywords, particularly if they pull quotable snippets form you to include in their coverage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>As an information hub for journalists:</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Press releases help journalists check information. When you make a press release, all the information you want journalists to know about your business is in one place. Even external documents, like research documents and presentations, are available in a press release, making it easy for journalists to find and accurately reference all the information they need to write their story about you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>As something to your message like what a refinery to a winery:</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Press releases refine your messaging. As you put your press release together, you need to ensure that you have nailed the message for the announcement to ensure maximum exposure. It is the place everyone will go to get the story and cite important data points. Once you have refined the message of your release, you are giving the right message for all other content creators to draw upon.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Disadvantages of Press Releases:</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>No help for your SEO:</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Press releases for marketing may not be directly helpful to your SEO. They can only help SEO if there is added editorial content published as a result of your press release. However, despite popular belief that press releases help your SEO efforts, they actually will not help as much as you think. Google experts say that verifying your SEO ranking in Google will not increase once a press release is posted.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Poor potentiality for outreach:</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Press releases will not improve your communication with customers. Press releases might get the attention of journalists, but it is very unlikely that it will reach your target audience. Customers like to read information in a way that feels natural and is easy to digest, like blog posts or news stories. The press release template takes longer to read and is usually harder to understand.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>No measurable success:</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Press releases are hard to measure. Data is the main method marketers prove success to the rest of their department and business. However, unlike others parts of your marketing strategy, press releases are very hard to measure, so it is hard to prove if they are successful or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Not cost-effective:</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Press releases are not cost-effective. Posting a single press release can cost hundreds (even thousands) of dollars. Most of the time, they are not picked up by journalists and are just reposted on other websites. They have become a little outdated as public relation relies more on building relationships with the media instead of sending press releases to journalists you might not even know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite all these setbacks, press releases for marketing were important, is still and will be useful if businesses know how to create and spread them across the right channels.</p>','press-releases_for_marketing_-_pros_and_cons.png','press-releases-for-marketing-pros-cons',0,0,0,0,1,'Should Your Brand Count On Press Releases For Marketing?','Press releases for marketing','Businesses and organizations have been using press releases for marketing for several decades while enjoying both their benefits and some clear drawbacks.

However, there are techniques and expenses involved which are crucial to your success.','<p>Twitter has currently over 330 million monthly users including 100 million daily active users who send 500 million tweets every 24 hours. Twitter is a social platform used to get the latest news and trends from around the world. Businesses can take advantage of Twitter advertisements to gain more followers for brand awareness, to drive people to their website, and to generate leads!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Growth of a Follower Base:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter Ads can be run strictly to gain more followers and to build a community base online. Followers have a chance to engage with a business and vice versa. Twitter followers cannot only share a businesses&rsquo; content with their friends, but they can also make purchases online. A small business study was conducted in 2014, which found that Twitter followers could help achieve substantial sales and reach for a business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once an account starts to gain more followers, it is essential that the business engage with them. Some of the popular ways to engage with an audience is to ask open-ended questions that can lead to a conversation. Another way to interact with followers is to post about real time trends so that followers have something to relate to. New Belgium Brewing Company did an excellent job of creating an ad during &ldquo;Shark Week&rdquo; to capture more followers and become a part of the conversation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Traffic Gathering:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter allows businesses to reach a specific audience tailored to a target demographic. When it comes to Twitter Ads, target people by location, gender, keywords, followers, interest, behaviors and more! Location can be broken down by country, state, and postal code. This allows even small local businesses to take advantage of advertisements to reach their target audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another feature advertisers need to take advantage of is to add keywords. Twitter allows advertisers to add keywords to target searches or users that may need your product or service. For example, a local coffee shop could target ads specifically to people that are tweeting about coffee. Twitter allows advertisers to add broad match, phrase match, negative unordered match, and negative phrase match keywords. The keyword match type is very similar to the types of keywords used for a SEM Campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another Twitter ads feature that must not be overlooked is the &ldquo;Add Followers&rdquo; feature. This feature allows a business to add followers that may be interested in its products or services. Advertisers may also add competitors&rsquo; twitter handles to try to reach their following.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Lead Generation:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the day what do all businesses want to achieve from ads? LEADS! Twitter allows businesses to add a Lead Generation Card to a promoted tweet, which allows users to share their contact information so a business can connect with them later. Getting an email address from a potential consumer can help with the success of an email marketing campaign. In order to get an email address from a consumer, the business must first make engaging content or do an exclusive offer to make people feel special.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter, like many other social media platforms, lets businesses run advertisements to reach an audience likely to have an interest in their business. It is important that businesses take advantage of Twitter ads as they are an easy way to increase brand awareness while also generating more leads and driving traffic to their website.</p>','want_to_know_about_twitter_ads.png','want-to-know-about-twitter-ads',0,0,0,1,1,'What Businesses and Brands Need To Know About Twitter Ads?','Twitter Ads','Businesses in the modern era have numerous ways like Twitter ads to advertise their services and utilities.

These backlinks if done appropriately work wonder.','<p>For those struggling to get a higher rank and receive an increasing quantity of traffic to a website, tiered backlink can be a magical thing to get busy with. Neither too simple nor too complicated, the strategy is not beyond anyone&rsquo;s measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In lieu of building websites that link back to you (low authority websites) for the sole purpose of building backlinks, you use guest posts on authoritative websites to link back to another guest post written by you in the same niche.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may be asking &ldquo;Where does my website link appear in all this story?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will get there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the first tier, you will mention your website. However, the second tier will only strengthen the first one to make the backlink to your website stronger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of building two backlinks, you build just one &ndash; a quite powerful one, at that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many things to be said about tiered link building, so let&rsquo;s get to it!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What do we not call tiered backlink building?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You are probably thinking to yourself, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to wreck my nerves trying to find authoritative websites and then get rejected because my content is not good enough. You could just use the old trick: buy expired domains and then create content on those websites that will strengthen each other, and then point the first tier to my website.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are right. You could do that. But that is a black hat technique that will get you penalized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creating websites that you use as tiers is not white hat tiered link building, and it most likely buries your website on page 10. If you want to rank higher, you will have to be able to produce high-quality content that is accepted by authoritative websites in your niche. That is the secret to tiered link building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tiered link building is all about guest posting on authoritative websites. You choose your first tier and the other websites point at it, while only the first-tier points at you. This is a white hat technique that can put you on the first page of Google when done properly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>From a black hat perspective:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;re not doing anyone any harm. You aren&rsquo;t wasting electricity for something useless like spamming either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your tier 2 posts are helping the owners of those sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By building contextual links to your high-quality tier 1 guest posts, you&rsquo;ll please the site&rsquo;s in which you posted those posts, as you&rsquo;ll not be the only person benefiting from that as those links will help drive the overall Domain Authority of those domains higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your content helps three parties in total: you, your tier 1 sites, your tier 2 sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How to find websites who are interested in your content?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An easy way to find your first tier is to look at Google trends in your niche. You could also perform a keyword search and pick between the first websites ranking for that keyword.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first tier must be the most powerful. The second should have a domain authority ranked at least 30.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep in mind that in tiered link building the second website strengthens the first, and only the first has a link back to your website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several ways to approach tiered backlink building. You can search for broken links in those websites and promise to replace them with working links to your content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can create an infographic that goes well with their content and then add a description to it which contains your link on your first tier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several approaches to guest posting. But no matter what you do, provide value. It makes the website owner you are pitching to happy, it makes Google happy, and it probably makes you smile too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AND, this is probably the logical conclusion to a primary overview of tiered backlinks.</p>','what_is_tiered_backlink.png','what-is-tiered-backlink',0,0,0,1,2,'A Critical Study On Tiered Backlinks &v Their Effectiveness','Tiered backlink','Tiered backlink is a great way to increase the traffic of a website while it might sound complex, and in some cases, an effort less worthy of trying.

Theirs was one of the techniques you won&rsquo;t find among Google&rsquo;s preferences. More specifically, those techniques could not be capable of tackling Google&rsquo;s new algorithm changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the penalty, the site used to receive thousands of visitors and hundreds of customers&rsquo; queries, e-mails each week. When the number of queries or visitors dropped quite shockingly in the first quarter of 2017, suspicions arose. It became almost impossible for Suggs Law<strong> </strong>to expect anything from Google because the giant pushed the site to as far as 9<sup>th</sup> page of the search results even though it was searched by its name only.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Problems:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The first big problem was about the links the site had. After thoroughly investing the site&rsquo;s link table, we found that there were links from low-quality, suspicious sources. Another issue we noticed that there was an unreasonable number of links coming from a single website. Also, there were several links using the same phrase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t mean to be rude, but the service provider did one thing going beyond the conventional expectation from an SEO service. &ldquo;They deserted the &lsquo;White Hat&rsquo; optimization technique.&rdquo; Can we really appreciate that? Such an action resulted in the discounts of inbound links and ultimate penalization. Consequently, the number of visitors plummeted, and so did the rankings.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Challenges:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>What do you expect from your digital marketing agency? You know. Suggs Law did the same. As we stated the problem, we believe you already have realized the challenges we had to overcome to put this story on this page. We were requested to get the site out of this trap.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How We Worked:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>What we did first, as per our knowledge, was remove bad links through proper technical methods although we found in some of our previous projects that bad links are not always removable. We got rd of the remaining links, disavowed actually through Google&rsquo;s Webmaster Tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be honest, we had to perform some SEO techniques, not a big deal really. We appreciated the content of the site because this part played its role nicely. In order to reduce bounce rates, we had to address several other issues, technical/development related indeed. Improving the usability, we made the site&rsquo;s navigation easy and increased the load speed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The result, the testimony of our success:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The site again appeared on Google&rsquo;s first page two months after our optimizations. While the site might appear at the top or second top position on Google&rsquo;s first phrase for certain words/phrases, Suggs Law<strong> </strong>became quite happy to see that they started receiving high-quality leads just like before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe, you are thinking of hiring a digital marketing agency to achieve such an amazing result in a month, right?

The one thing that remains constant is our unending efforts to maintain relevance, consistency, and a tendency to add value to the audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far, we have worked with the following types of contents.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Educational Content</li>\r\n	<li>Product Showcase</li>\r\n	<li>Behind-The-Scene Content</li>\r\n	<li>Fun Content</li>\r\n	<li>Company&rsquo;s Cultural Representation</li>\r\n	<li>User-Generated Content</li>\r\n	<li>Customer Tales</li>\r\n	<li>Team Member Takeovers</li>\r\n	<li>Introduction to the Team</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Use of HASHTAG has changed, and so have our techniques.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Employing a significant amount of time to handle the hashtags is a great part of any Instagram Marketing Package we offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since users are now able to do more with hashtags, we, the marketers can leverage this enhanced functionality to the benefits of our clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This new feature has enabled us to find a new way for our clients&rsquo; businesses to reach new audiences. We are happy that we can promote your branded tags and expand the message of your brand in a new way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We find out the target audiences and the specific hashtags they are following. Then, we prepare a list of focused tags. In most cases, we have found some tags to be consistent among audiences. We emphasize those tags to maximize your reach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We do not put off the opportunity of encouraging your audience, so they follow your branded hashtags. These could be particularly useful during events when you want increased participation and improved coverage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of our small yet valuable tricks&hellip;&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of focusing on the popular tags only, we research the many hashtags your audiences are using. After preparing a list, we use them within your posts. Then, we monitor the performance of the tags.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>We bring you the most of Instagram Stories.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We do not simply leave the opportunity to showcase posts or stories of some important events, products, or customer interactions. We explore all ways the tool is usable so that we can find what works best for your particular business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Messenger Day is more powerful with Facebook Stories&hellip;...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are quite adept at using this cross-post feature. After a lot of hard work, we have devised a unique technique to overcome the formatting issues in Instagram Stories. The content can be cropped nicely to fit into the feed of Facebook/Messenger Stories. So, you aren&rsquo;t missing anything that you shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each Instagram marketing package that we have created includes all the techniques applicable to Instagram Stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The introduction to Instagram Live was exciting for us. But why?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe this feature has added a new dimension to the way we used to promote brands using Instagram. With innovative promotional opportunities for businesses, this feature allows you to have different guests on your brand&rsquo;s live-stream. Sometimes, we do it for some of our clients who make their particular broadcasting processes less intimidating. By doing so, we can add as many contexts as we need to achieve a specific goal. In most cases, we love this feature for Q&amp;A Sessions and interviews.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Let&rsquo;s know about Instagram Ads.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We have mastered the techniques to launch an Instagram ads campaign that can work as a great boost to your Instagram marketing. Our services start from the design and creation of relevant, appealing, unique, and logical ads and continues up to the setup and finalization of the ads campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>So, you need to ensure consistency.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite all the BIG changes, Instagram is, at its core, a visual means of socialization. So, consistency is pivotal. We do not usually fail to maintain it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How do we make sure all these happen?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To ensure it, we keep analyzing how your target audiences behave, use Instagram and react to particular events. If we have to, we reorganize our work plan based on the monthly reports. We do an in-depth social audit to bring our clients the ultimate success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As included in every Instagram marketing package at Doodle Digital, our visual strategy is clear and accommodating to a wide range of variable situations. We have discovered the visualization techniques that work across multiple contexts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having confusions or questions?

Local SEO offers you a substantial way to let Google or Bing know that you are doing businesses, and they should notice that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In most cases when we get involved in doing local SEO citation building service, we work with a particular objective; that is to get the client businesses on Google&rsquo;s first page (in Organic Listings and Map Pack).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Setup and Optimization of Google My Business and Bing Places</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the majority of our clients, we had to deal with this step before finally initiating our local SEO citation building service. Because it is vital that your business appears on local map listings shown in the search engine results pages, you cannot merely ignore Google My Business or Bing Places. Google gets the priority, but Bing is obviously the second.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is the checklist we maintain:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Putting in the required and relevant information and making sure the profile/account is 100% completed.</li>\r\n	<li>Creating or choosing a relatable profile picture or other images of your brand with the file(s) being named with the target keyword(s).</li>\r\n	<li>Correct categorization and keeping a record of the format in which, the business name, address, and phone number have been used.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Keyword Research:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At Doodle Digital, we take this step with the all our available resources. We make the nearly the best use of Google Keyword Planner. Sometimes, we try to find what we want or need from our in-depth competitor analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, we combine local and long-tail keywords that are exclusively pertinent to your local business. It makes our job easier to find more relevant keywords. Also, we create a great transition between the increasingly popular keyword modifiers like cheap, low-cost, best, affordable, etc. Google Trends is one of our favorite companions as we start looking into the current status of the keywords we are using.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>On-Page SEO:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We take care of everything that this stage includes. From keyword research to the indexing step, we work with a pair of keen and vigilant eyes. This step includes keyword research and optimization of title tags, meta descriptions, anchor text, heading tags, URLs, and images with the specific keyword and the town name (the name of the business location).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We ensure that your local business site is 100% responsive to mobile and other devices. Since 56% of all customers use mobile devices to buy or receive products or services from local shops or services, we believe no businesses should ignore that. We can take care of this with utmost skills and efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creation and Placement of Schema Tags:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are quite professionally versed in creating Schema markup and place it on your website to shape the way how your site appears on the SERPs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We Keep These Ranking Factors In Mind&hellip;..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We know the differences between the factors of global and local SEO. Here are the things we do to address the local SEO ranking factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Proper categorization of your business in Google My Business</li>\r\n	<li>Assurance of local citation building service in a consistent manner</li>\r\n	<li>Availability of quality local citation service to receive citations from different authoritative sites</li>\r\n	<li>Arrangements to improve Domain Authority (DA)</li>\r\n	<li>High-quality backlinks</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Citations:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As we know, these are critical to the success of your local SEO campaign, we have designed our citation building service to help any local business grow quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years, we have worked with numerous local businesses and offered them our local SEO citation building service. The result was sometimes satisfactory, and sometimes, more than satisfactory.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Optimizing to Rank in Local Map Pack Results:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To ensure that we do it right, we double check the NAP (Name, Address, and Phone Number) and other data.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Building Credibility and Reviews:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We do whatever ethical is required to build the credibility of your business. We create the site in a way that it quickly lets other people leave their reviews quite easily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides all the services, we include the following aspects of our services.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Backlink Building Strategies for Local SEO</li>\r\n	<li>Google Analytics and Google Search Console Setup</li>\r\n	<li>Local SEO Audit</li>\r\n	<li>Competitor&rsquo;s SEO Audit</li>\r\n	<li>Tracking the Progress</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you begin your journey with our local SEO citation building service; you will have not a single thing to worry about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, we are committed to working this way.</p>','a:4:{s:22:\"basic_pricing_subtitle\";s:30:\"Per Monthly (Subscription Fee)\";s:23:\"silver_pricing_subtitle\";s:30:\"Per Monthly (Subscription Fee)\";s:21:\"gold_pricing_subtitle\";s:30:\"Per Monthly (Subscription Fee)\";s:24:\"premium_pricing_subtitle\";s:30:\"Per Monthly (Subscription Fee)\";}',NULL,0,0,0.00,'local.png','a:4:{s:18:\"pricing_info_title\";s:34:\"Let\'s Inform & Deliver Your Locals\";s:10:\"step_title\";s:18:\"100% Reach Ensured\";s:13:\"step_subtitle\";s:66:\"The Proven Startegy To Make People See, Listen & Care Your Stories\";s:10:\"step_image\";s:26:\"local-pakg-footer-icon.png\";}','Local SEO Citation Building Service | Proven Citation Building Service','ocal SEO citation building service','Local SEO being an important factor for local businesses/brands calls for the need of affordable yet efficient local SEO citation building service that we proudly offer at Doodle Digital.',1,NULL,1,'2018-01-03 00:39:05','2018-03-29 05:43:21'),(4,5,'Organic SEO','organic-seo',NULL,'organic_packge_1.jpg','<h2>Embrace A Way That Doesn&#39;t Fail You</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We optimize every page, and it&rsquo;s a must.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, what do we optimize?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The design of the site?

Let&rsquo;s get to the brief walkthrough for a substantial understanding of the organic SEO services we have been providing here at Doodle Digital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is a brief walkthrough of our organic SEO services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each package we offer incorporates four different phases which ultimately lead to a great achievement.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Analysis is our beginning step.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we prepare a detailed report of the existing SEO situation with Penguin and Panda survival, your website&rsquo;s overall performance, and other technical factors, we do not start. We conduct a thorough analysis of your competitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We spend much time to investigate the Search Engine Results Pages to learn what, in the eye of Google, is relevant to the keywords&rsquo; searches. With this understanding, we move onto the research stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We do some hard work to find a set of keywords consisting of one primary and some related keywords that share the intent of searchers involved in your world. We ensure that all those keywords or phrases work identically to enable the content to serve the intent. This is how our optimization activities advance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>On-Page Optimization comes second.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We understand the value of a compelling title. It means our writers do not use crappy titles that distract readers instead of engaging them to a large piece of content. We provide real value to readers and search engines when it comes to the meta descriptions. Abiding by the set standards of titles and meta descriptions, we provide useful content in a specified timeframe. We let Google understand our visual content as well by optimizing the images and adding meta tags.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our content creators are aware of the fact that these specific keywords/phrases bear tremendous semantic value, especially when Google considers these terms as a connector between searchers&rsquo; queries and your content. They optimize every piece of content using H1, H2, Bold, and other relevant tags to the content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With adequate knowledge and understanding of XML Sitemap, Search Engine&rsquo;s Authentication, and Robot.txt optimization, we can get your site indexed correctly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We make sure Google can crawl and access the URLs of your website and parse the text and understand the visual elements of the site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We spend our valuable resources to create fast-loading, visually appealing, and responsive websites that gladden the traffic the moment they land on them. We also integrate a WordPress Blog with your website to enable your business enjoy the full advantage of blogging.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Off-Page Optimization is no less important to us.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Here comes another remarkable part of our organic SEO packages. This is all about content creation and submission to different platforms across the world wide web. You can rely on us from creation of videos, press releases, blogs, reviews, images for social media to the submission of these contents and social bookmarking.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>We pay attention to Tracking &amp; Monitoring of everything.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is one of the quintessential parts of our full-fledged SEO service packages. At this stage, we perform the installation and collection of reports and insights generated by Google Analytics and Webmaster Tool. We keep track of rankings and traffic on a monthly basis to ensure that your business is on the right track.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t worry if you want our supports in the meantime.

Then, we love to share our insights about the reality of the affiliate world before we start describing our Amazon niche site building service in a complete detail.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Past, Present &amp; Future of Affiliate Marketing:</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Gone are the days of black hats, cookie stuffing, typo squatting, or spam.</li>\r\n	<li>No duplicate or thin content is going to bring you success.</li>\r\n	<li>It is not the case that the design of a niche site has little or no impact on its ranking success.</li>\r\n	<li>Wrong is the idea that a niche site cannot be large or contain over 10-20 pages of content.</li>\r\n	<li>The population of Amazon affiliates is on the increase.</li>\r\n	<li>Not all the lucrative niches have already been saturated.</li>\r\n	<li>A niche means a small segment of a product/ market.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Now straight to the point!!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Things you will get from our Amazon niche site building service:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Niche Selection and Identification of the Target Audience:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe competitiveness is a positive thing for both you and us. We look at the niches that are competitive very much differently than how average people or marketers do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We shortlist a few niches considering if you are interested in a long-term project. Then, we apply our skills to finally choose and create a unique, individualized angle to stand out in the niche, but of course, we keep your preferences in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, by the way, we do some hard work to identify your target audience as soon as we are done with the selection. This identification greatly facilitates each step that we take while having an Amazon affiliate website done for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Keyword Research:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We follow every golden rule of keyword research plus some of our special and proven techniques to discover relevant longtail keywords with the highest potential for success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We use a substantial amount of time to complete this step as we often count on our manual efforts. But, do not worry as we have access to the most trusted and useful tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Design and Technical Considerations:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is like the building block of our Amazon niche site building service. Here are the things we do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We choose a domain name that synchronizes with your selected niche and the mindset of your target audience. We do not let our clients worry about the strength and other technical aspects of web servers because we employ what is best for the job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We create/develop a custom theme for your website that is not only lightweight and fast but also useful with tons of features and functionalities. We agree to work with your chosen theme as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We create a unique, standard, and appropriate logo that speaks precisely for your website. Our creative thinkers do not rest until they find something more communicable and resonant. However, we are always open to accept what you want us to implement. In this case, the only thing we do is bring the required freshness and vigor to your concept.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are not like an average affiliate marketing website builder that cares only about the fact that the site needs to be completed on time and budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the design stage, our talented designers create a symmetry between the content and design with 100% responsiveness and user convenience in mind. We add the required functions and APIs to ensure that the website is easy to use. Ultimately, we take care of everything that is required for an aesthetically appealing and user-friendly site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike a common Amazon niche site builder, we have a serious focus on the fact that the world has gone mobile. Among over 3.5 billion of internet users, 93% heavily count on their mobile phones to simply visit websites, get answers to questions, seek entertaining content, or shop from marketplaces. How can we ignore such a striking factor so easily? NO, WE DON&rsquo;T.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every time we deliver our affiliate website building service to a client, we ensure cross-device and cross-browser compatibility. So, no worries at all!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&ldquo;Content Still Holds the Lion&rsquo;s Share&rdquo;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We understand it is one of the biggest concerns every potential affiliate marketer gets concerned about. Although any authority niche site creation service would offer content services, you cannot tell how efficiently the content can perform, especially when you do not know how they handle the quality assurance or check on the niche site content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A common trend that most content services seem to follow is &ldquo;Less Research, More Write-ups.&rdquo; To be honest, our writers hate working this way. They spend hours unless the genuinely useful information becomes available for the specific keywords or longtail phrases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have spent years to understand what readers or potential customers want to see on a website and its content. We have developed strategic approaches to creating authentic, valuable, original, and insightful content that helps, persuades, and converts readers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A standard niche site building service package at Doodle Digital includes a pillar article (a long article with lots of information, links, images, insights, etc.) and ten well-researched and well-written product reviews. Our writers have a knack for using keywords in so natural and intelligent a way that you may barely be able to detect one inside the content while going through it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We check the facts, information, keyword density and placement, uniqueness, and hyperlinked sources again and again for making sure that you are getting a top-notch writing service for your Amazon niche site. As on Google&rsquo;s, plagiarism/duplication and keyword stuffing are on our blacklist too.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What about the monetization strategy?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is one of the major phases of our niche website creation service. While the above steps will get your site on Google, this is the stage where you will actually be looking for a way to make a fortune from your niche site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We pick the most profitable monetization strategy. There are several ways to do it. Providing information is perhaps a very fascinating yet challenging technique. We are versed in employing any monetization strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Link building is not dead yet&hellip;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Every second we spend on this special activity is worth the outcome we can bring in while expecting to get your site on Google&rsquo;s first page. We use both basic and advanced link building strategies but in a quite distinct fashion to achieve wonderful results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still got a question? We understand your concern, but we really do not want to test your patience by presenting you a very long description of our packages for niche site creations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please feel free to ask any question about our Amazon niche site building service.

Well, keep reading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With all these facts about Twitter in mind, we cannot be like a digital marketing pro with some average Twitter marketing packages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are the basics of our Twitter marketing packages; no matter which one you choose.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>We do not delay in claiming your account name.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe the domain name of your website is what a handle is to your Twitter account. Which name you should pick and how you can manage a great Twitter handle that attracts the majority of your traffic are our concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>We carry over everything concerning your brand.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We understand how important it is for a brand to maintain cohesion and consistency all the way, from its website to the social media. Do not worry if you already have the colors, imagery, fonts, and other visual elements of the branding process. We can create great cohesion that helps your Twitter account communicate efficiently across a broad spectrum of business situations and different types of audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>We create a great Twitter bio.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We know how to create a succinct, lucid, and compelling representation of your brand even being restricted to 140 characters. Then, we place a link to your site, quite intelligently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creating a branded voice is all we aim at. That we cannot go beyond just 140 characters does not mean that a branded voice is hard to create. It might be anything from serious or professional to comical or casual depending on the brand you are trying to promote through Twitter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><em>A Tweet = A Teaser, An Informer, A Salespeople.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The above equation should be in the center of a tweet, and we do it real good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your tweets cannot tickle your audience&rsquo;s curiosity or interest, the most of your tweet holds no value. We try to manage the Twitter content in a way that your customers would feel an intense interest in reading them. The tweets are created, in most cases, to inform people who are really in need of the information.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>We maintain a purposeful focus.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We are capable of delivering whatever you want from our Twitter marketing packages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Want us to sell? Need us to inform? A mix of both? We are ready. But, you need not worry about being too salesy or overly pushing about sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A Retweet works great.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We know. We do it to make your audience or follower feel that you care about people who follow you. Respectful, useful, and relatable, the retweets are nothing short of the tweets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How do we make you an expert?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We find a convenient timeframe for holding a Q&amp;A Session weekly or monthly or on a timely basis. The purpose is to familiarize your expertise with people who love to know and inform. We take this as a great way to establish your identity as an expert.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How do we leverage automation?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Your website might have a great blog post that is worth the attention of hundreds if not thousands of your customers o potential buyers. How do you share that valuable piece? How can your followers find your magical content in their feeds? We can and will do it with just one click. How? Just avail one of our Twitter Marketing Packages and see how this happens.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>We are among the &ldquo;Masterminds.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides these steps, we have something more in store to make you feel happy with the outcome of using Twitter for business marketing. We have great familiarity, more than just acquaintance, with people who are influential and ready to do retweet your posts. In exchange for what? We&rsquo;ll take care of that too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Didn&rsquo;t we tell you we are good at taking your Twitter standing to the next level?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any Question?

Can you accept that one second of explainer video can show what as many as 30 pictures can? Believe or not; a one-minute video, crafted by a creative mind, can save nearly two million words.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Another perspective&hellip;&hellip;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>People with love to shop often feel an intense interest in watching what they are going to pay for. A video is perhaps an unbeatable way to satisfy the curiosity of your potential buyers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Videos on social media get more shares than images and text combined. Want to know how many?</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>An overwhelming <span style=\"font-size:20px\"><strong>1200%&nbsp;</strong></span>!!! No surprises!!!</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>If you ever find both text and video on a particular topic, you are likely to prefer the video. Nobody needs to read your inner psyche to tell this. So, why won&rsquo;t your target audience do the same?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe, you won&rsquo;t ever ask why your business would need online video marketing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because we are informed of what works in this digital era, we feel it right to share with you how you can benefit from our video marketing services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following is the phases we maintain while serving any of our video service packages.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>CONCEPTUALIZATION comes first.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Do we find out what your audience really cares about? Yes, but for a different reason.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We try to find something about your brand or product that your audience might feel interested in. Then, we do some hard work to study your audience both existing and potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>STRATEGY comes next.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the stage where we develop a structure for the video. Toward a consistent tone, we set the dynamics, visuals, sound, and structure of the video.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it is an animated explainer video your business needs, we determine whether it should be a text-based thing or a voiceover. We have a full-fledged setup to bring you an impressive result with the use of animated videos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For other videos, we determine if they should be a panel discussion or an interview or a monologue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since naming a single or a series of video is critical, we try to incorporate your brand, culture, keyword, and style into the video so that it resonates with your brand and persuades your audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Key Points:</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Recording and editing should be done in a proven manner.</li>\r\n	<li>Don&rsquo;t worry. We have professional HD cameras.</li>\r\n	<li>More importantly, film and media professional</li>\r\n	<li>Video content distribution has to be in a solid way. We apply this principle most vigorously for our YouTube video marketing services.</li>\r\n	<li>Not all social media are equally prospective for your brand. But, we strategize our distribution system in a way that your brand receives great coverage on every social channel.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Online video marketing involves more than mere creation and sharing of videos. Every single video created by our talented animators and editors include what your audience might want to see and share. We make sure a strong CALL-TO-ACTION is present; no matter how short or long your video is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have a very transparent and legible answer if you want to know how we will ensure that each video that we create for a client is good enough to make people at least think about your brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our professionals know how to maintain the following things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Camera stability, Great Audio &amp; Perfect Lighting Conditions</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How do we determine the size of the video?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We do not set a fixed length. Why? Very simple&hellip;&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What particular distribution strategy we adopt and which channels we use are the two key factors we take into consideration while setting the length of a video. We follow this practice because we have found this method more effective than others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, need to know how long? Well, we prefer SHORTER videos to the larger ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After knowing all these, you might still have a question. How do we initiate the final stage of online video marketing? This is how we launch the whole thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>We promote every video that we think is a part of your business.</li>\r\n	<li>We do the essentials to ensure a solid connection between your social media and blog and website through the videos.</li>\r\n	<li>We prepare a set of tasks and take the steps carefully while focusing on the ultimate success of the campaign.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Enough of our steps, huh? Now, you might feel interested in telling us what you want and how video can be of help.

But, you do not want to pay for the content that adds little value to your audience causing them not to trust you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember that your target audience always looks for something that answers their questions or offers the information they want. If your content fails to enlighten them with what they want, chances grow that you will never be trusted or liked by the visitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is the content of your website that makes your brand credible and interesting among the potential customers.

Even, I&rsquo;ve a team of marketing individuals with consummate promotional skills. What have I missed then?&rdquo; You have missed something called the brand development strategy which is more than the logo and equal to the product(s)/service(s). Oh, you have forgotten about your brand. So, how do you dub your brand?</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>The source of promises made by you to your customers/clients</li>\r\n	<li>One of the foundational elements in your business&rsquo;s marketing communication</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you agree to accept these facts about branding; Doodle Digital will step forward with a unique and time-tested brand identity planning that is specifically tailored to ensure the BRAND IMAGERY DEVELOPMENT for your business.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How do we begin?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You might have hired a personal branding strategist. Does that professional know what specific purpose your business serves and why you even need a complete brand development strategy? We start with the functional purpose of your business. We believe your business possesses an intentional objective which needs to be consistent with not only the industry&rsquo;s trends but also the resources you have at your disposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Here comes the first PRACTICAL step.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Doodle Digital identifies the EMOTION that connects customers with a brand. Every brand identity planning session that we hold for a valued client includes the much needed emotional impact relevant to the individual business. Buying decisions often are the results of emotions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-size:26px\">Purpose &rarr; Consistency &rarr; Emotional Impact</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With sharp eyes on this flow of actions, we create your BRAND NAMING as well as BRAND STORY.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How do we leverage today&rsquo;s economy?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>No businesses can survive ignoring the economy. On the flip side, your business needs to have the strength and strategy to leverage the current economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you still love to listen to what your competitors say about themselves? Maybe, times have changed, and we no longer care what people or businesses say about themselves. All that matters is what people talk about businesses. Be prepared! It&rsquo;s the testimonial economy we are abiding in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We make sure your business boasts a league of ambassadors who are proactive to spread their love and respect of your business online. This is how they can ensure a solid VISUAL IDENTITY of your business, and it ultimately leads to a strong BRAND POSITIONING that enables your brand to become visible to the right audience. Of course, we put some of our proven techniques into action to make this happen sooner than later.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&ldquo;We let you know who your clients really are.&rdquo;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a must for you to know who your customers or clients are in real life. It is included in our work plan for your corporate identity planning that we present you with a vivid picture of your customer base. The picture includes the key elements of your customers&rsquo; demographics which can be critical to any brand positioning strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How do we generate value for your customers?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We craft our IDENTITY PLANNING in a way that people find their language embedded in it. We believe your business can reach more people faster and more convincingly if we can make the following two things happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>We create a corporate branding strategy that instills a voice in your brand.<br />\r\nAND the brand speaks the way people speak to their close associates.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike an average branding agency or sleazy corporate branding firms, we focus on providing helpful content, real-life experience, discussions, and knowledge relevant to your business using the online social platforms. Have you ever used LinkedIn&rsquo;s Long-Form Posts? We already have and demonstrated how it is possible to promote or build the VERBAL IDENTITY of your brand without really appearing to keep marketing your product/service at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t your brand development strategy run this way?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>We work for B2B Businesses:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Constructing a purpose-driven B2B business development strategy is the first thing we do to make it a great platform for your B2B concern to build upon. The strategy we can build for you can create a boon for your business evolution. We instill vibrant energy in the branding plan that can keep drawing in people in a way that they may become interested in helping your business grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Things we can do for B2C Businesses:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We understand how B2B and B2C concerns differ from each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, our B2C marketing strategy entails the identification of a target market, significantly larger than any B2B market. We create a well-thought B2C brand strategy that allows for a great number of small sales so that we can adjust it to accommodate a cycle of short sales and a viable technique to move your customers through the buying spectrum. Short will be the sales consisting of a single phase with a focus on catering to customers&rsquo; impulsiveness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We work this way because &ndash;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>One of the prerequisites of a successful B2C branding strategy is the proper publicity of your products or services along with their benefits.</li>\r\n	<li>We know how to tap into the motivational emotions of your individual buyers.</li>\r\n	<li>We know that the purchases are done on impulses or without any prior plan.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Doodle Digital believes in the fact that people always remember how you can make them feel instead of what you did for them. We help you make your customers feel the authenticity and solidity of your brand by creating a purposeful, businesslike, and integrated brand development strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still having a second thought? Just let us know.</p>','<p>A brand development strategy, as Doodle Digital emphasizes, should be the embodiment of the circulation of your brand message that people care about.</p>','[{\"feature_title\":\"Brand Naming\",\"feature_description\":\"Simple, easy to understand and rebot designed.

The marketing landscape was never this challenging and volatile until the discovery of newer technologies and thinktanks of digitalization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The question is if you really want to go for online advertising to succeed. We know that your only answer is YES. Maybe, you would like us to speak now.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>We turn your website into a virtual magic land that hooks people.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While some of the best advertising campaigns on the market ignore the importance of good websites for the success of online advertising, we do quite the opposite. We spend some of our time and much of our effort to design a good website that loads fast and offers a visually pleasing look alongside easy navigation and other conveniences. The goal here is to create a website that hooks the attention of your visitors and binds them for some time; at least as long as it takes them to go through your site at a glance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>We investigate the market.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Since we aim at creating an impact through advertisements, we investigate the market to identify and segment the target audience. By doing so, we come to know who we are targeting and can design the advertisement(s) accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Here is our PPC management procedure&hellip;&hellip;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Here comes the most important part of the activities conducted by a digital advertising agency. Since we have in-depth knowledge about AdWords management, we conduct our PPC management through AdWords for outstanding results as Google is the first to receive a huge amount of traffic and deliver the most number of impressions and clicks.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>We make sure that our advertising activities are regular and consistent. Further, we analyze the performance of the account. For the desired outcome, we make the following adjustments.</li>\r\n	<li>We try to expand the overall reach of a PPC campaign by adding keywords relevant to the business.</li>\r\n	<li>We reduce expenses by adding negative or non-converting keywords in an intelligent manner.</li>\r\n	<li>Sometimes, we split ad groups into more relevant yet smaller groups with the goal to bring in more targeted landing pages and ad text. This way, we work to improve the quality score and click-through rate.</li>\r\n	<li>In our PPC management plan, we include a review plan to find out the components that are leading to more expenses or not performing expectedly. Once we have identified the loose ends; we take immediate actions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>We understand the types of advertisements.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We find where your target audience stays active most of the time of a day. In most cases, audiences are on Facebook. The majority of online audiences love to watch videos. Even, some prefer tweeting and retweeting. While advertising on social media, we keep in mind these tendencies and platforms people prefer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>We accurately determine your digital advertising benefits and goals.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a professional digital advertising agency, we try to determine what you exactly want to achieve or do with your digital media advertising campaign. Throughout the years, we have seen businesses adopting advertising campaigns to accomplish diverse goals, such as more traffic generation, lead generation, increase in sales, brand image development, etc. Some try to achieve one or two of these while some aim at getting the mix of everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proudly speaking, we have conducted many successful advertising campaigns and brought our customers outstanding results within a given timeframe.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Here is how we design your advertisement.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We know we are not going to get ample space to create a beautiful message and design an unquestionably impressive digital advertisement for you. But, the shortage of space cannot restrict our ability to design a powerful advertisement that contains your brand image, message, and whatever more you want used to attract the traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We know it is not very easy to make people interested in clicking the ads. So, we take this task with great, great seriousness; especially when we try to use visual elements that speak louder than the words themselves. Maybe, you need to know things more clearly and specifically. Well, here you go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because we are trying to make a sense of urgency, we do not believe in more if only three words can convey the message. We think why a visitor should click on the advertisement. This is how things go easy for us. We take care of the linguistic factors too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are a little more cautious about using a call to action (CTA). Sadly, we have seen many businesses paying top dollars for digital media advertising without any good prospect of success, and the key reason includes poorly/wrongly crafted CTAs or no CTAs at all. But, we modify each piece of content or CTA with the individual search queries included precisely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we use images as the visual elements for your ads, we never use low-quality images that fail to vividly show what you want your audience to see.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>We measure anything and everything.</li>\r\n	<li>Our digital advertising team measures how the advertisements are performing in real time.</li>\r\n	<li>They analyze an entire campaign in detail.</li>\r\n	<li>The find ways to maximize the benefits using the available resources and overcoming the existing challenges.</li>\r\n	<li>They devise techniques to adapt to the changes quickly.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of a digital advertising agency, each of us has the right passion and required motivation to bring your digital advertising campaign to an end that you would even not expect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contact us to learn more!!!</p>','<p>Digital advertising has changed a lot during the past decade.

According to the mastermind, the purpose of design is to take care of the look, feel and function. Since, we offer creative service for business, we create a symmetry among the function, look, and feel. The same is true for our efforts to bring you a web design layout.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The way we use colors, typefaces, images, and other effects:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Having a complete conceptuality in mind, we make use of complementary colors because they are critical to the balance and harmony among the different parts of the design layout. The background and text have to be easy on readers&rsquo; eyes. So, we use contrasting colors. To make sure that the design incorporates a sufficient amount of emotion and attractions, we use vibrant colors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, we are wary of the uses of white space. The ultimate goal is to bring about an uncluttered design that diffuses a contemporary look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We employ a decisive plan for using typefaces in the design because the text needs to be easy to read. So, we streamline the design with your brand&rsquo;s goal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A significant amount of our design efforts goes invested in images which, we believe, one of the few most powerful elements to attract people&rsquo;s attention on the Internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We consider a lot of navigation elements, such as page hierarchy, uses and positions of bread crumbs, buttons, and other sections.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Our animation services make a statement.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Our animation artists can breathe life onto a dull canvas. Must we say more? Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They can make you believe that what they render is actually lively, and not just some cartoons. It is the artistic knack of our animator that enables him to bring reality into the animated characters or objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We abide by the fundamentals of animation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the animation guru Disney suggests, we remember each principle while working. So far, we have learned 12 golden rules, and you will see them in every action we take while creating an animation for your business.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>About our talent in motion graphics:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving a graphic is more than a mastery over tools like After Effects, Edge Animate, etc. We strongly believe that mastery of craft has only a little to do with that of tools. The art of motion graphics has its own grammar just like any area of professionalism or education. Graphics artists at Doodle Digital are have a sound understanding of those rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>About our infographics service:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While creating an infographic for you, we try to focus on a problem-solving one, especially the topic that answers to the burning questions in your area of business. Our activities for creating infographics include an approach to find the gap in the existing knowledge and information bases and offer relevant content to address the issue.

What do you see? Google or Bing has come up with countless links pointing toward several social media marketing ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adopting the most popular marketing strategies using social media seems a good step. But, how much good is really good for you? Among the so-called effective social media marketing strategies, the one that consistently delivers you new conversions, customers, and sales is the only good strategy you would want to use for your brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where will you find such a goal-driven social media marketing strategy? How do you supercharge your social media? You are just where you need to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Determining Objectives:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The heart of effective social media marketing strategies is a set of goals that companies work hard to achieve. Once you have decided to work with us; our experts will discuss the overall prospects and social media needs of your business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, they will determine specific and relevant goals that are both measurable and attainable, and of course, bound to a specific timeframe. Confused?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Facebook, we will create content and share photos that clearly communicate the culture and goals of your business. We will post two pieces of content and relevant photos each week, one on Monday and another on Thursday. We aim at getting at least 50 likes and 10 comments for each post and the accompanying photos. This is just an example. We can do even more for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Quality? Quantity? Or Both?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In a word, a mix of both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From our studies of the user demographics, we have learned one thing that people keep reading or sharing content that speaks to their heart, humor, feelings, and needs. For the past few years, we have done this (a little of both quantity and quality) several times and met great success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have also seen that people want to get their favorite things almost daily, and sometimes, several times a day. We take this opportunity to instill the image of your brand into the audience through careful yet smart content development strategy, which is a very good part of effective social media marketing strategies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the posts we make for your social media development, promotional content makes twenty percent while educational content makes the rest. We create buyer personas and try to find out what customers believe is important for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our promotional content includes call-to-action text with useful information that customers would find useful. The information can be an offer of discount or a piece of very relevant information or statistics. We try to bring in influencer content that resonates with your business. Sometimes, we provide content that is written by an industry expert whose goal remains focused on helping people persuasively.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Post Scheduling:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To do this job properly, we have to know when your followers, subscribers, or target audiences are online. As said in the previous lines, we study user behaviors, interests, likes, dislikes, reactions, etc. to learn what specific time of the day is liked most by the majority of your followers. When people get something interesting every time they visit your page or attempt to see what new thing you have presented, the likelihood of success increases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We adopt the most advanced technique and tool to know when your audiences are online and how long they spend on the different social media channels. Even we use efficient tools to handle bulk posting.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How do we engage with followers?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To be honest, we have a set of very special techniques to ensure greater engagement with followers. Before working on this, we have several essentials in place, such as the socializing habits, interests, attentions, needs, and interactions of the followers. Combining insights from all these elements, we prepare a very detailed engagement plan that makes a crucial part of our effective social media marketing strategies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&ldquo;We spend some time to look at the competitors.&rdquo;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Your competitors, both knowingly and unknowingly, offer a way to know what works best for you and what lowers the prospect of your brand. We include this as a critical step in our social media strategy outline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we even start applying any minor step, we observe how particular techniques are working for your competitors. We check into the content, media components, conversations, and other social interactions found on the pages/profiles of your competitor businesses. By doing this, we may know about the unforeseeable future of your brand&rsquo;s social media presence.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&ldquo;We track changes, progress, and the overall performance.&rdquo;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Since we love to call ours some of the most effective social media marketing strategies, we put together a lot of small details to make the whole thing work to your benefit. We keep an eye on every little and subtle changes in your social media metrics and take the required actions decisively to ensure that success comes on time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can create a well-thought strategy for social media marketing for your business anytime leaving you only one task to do. We just want to know what you have to tell.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><u>Important Highlights:</u></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Goal Setting</li>\r\n	<li>Mix of Quality &amp; Quantity</li>\r\n	<li>Social Media Content Management</li>\r\n	<li>User Engagement Techniques</li>\r\n	<li>Competitor Analysis</li>\r\n	<li>Performance Monitoring</li>\r\n</ul>','<p>Doodle Digital is proud to offer effective social media marketing strategies for businesses that are struggling or looking to boost their social media metrics.</p>','[{\"feature_title\":\"Strategy Development\",\"feature_description\":\"Simple, easy to understand and rebot designed.

From the very start our SEO professionals will perform a deep analysis of your business to understand the market you’re competing in and the specific practices your competitors engage in to compete online.\nOur approach to SEO focuses on revealing the facts and letting those facts dictate every aspect of the campaign. We choose the keywords your campaign uses, the structure your website takes, and the channels we focus on for off-page based on the results of this analysis. Our research-oriented approach ensures that results are consistently achieved rather than taking a “one-size fits all” approach.\nYou can expect your SEO campaign to be a long-term investment, often requiring 3-6 months before seeing a return. We are upfront about this, but what sets us apart from the competition are the long-term results we achieve. Instead of getting your name ranked and then subsequently losing it, we work to establish your brand as an authority, encouraging search engines to consistently feature your pages at the top of the results.\";}i:1;a:2:{s:9:\"faq_title\";s:48:\"How does Doodle Digital charge for SEO services?\";s:15:\"faq_description\";s:633:\"Each campaign is different.
